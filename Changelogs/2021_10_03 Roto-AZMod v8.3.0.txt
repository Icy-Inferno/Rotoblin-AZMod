   * **Tanks:**
 	* Disables the Car Alarm when a Tank hittable hits the alarmed car.
	* Make AI Tank be more stupid and allow suicide if stuck, think twice if you wanna pass tank to AI.
 
  * **Boomer:**
	* Make sure Boomers are unable to bile Survivors during a stumble (basically reinforce shoves)
 
  * **Hunter:**
    * claw Damage: 4 (vanilla: 6)
    * Allow Hunters being shoved when not pouncing. (Shove fov: **90**)
	
* Survivors:
	* Water Slowdown outside of Tank fights.
	* No Water Slowdown during Tank fights.
	* Fixed if one of survivors didn't leave out saferoom completely, infected players can use endless instant spawn. (one of l4d1 original feature)

	* Prevents swapping to secondary weapon on primary weapon pick up when its clip is empty

	* Survivors can climb the wall during ready up.
